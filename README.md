## Basic Sentiment Analysis Model

This repository contains a simple Python script for sentiment analysis using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of texts and their corresponding binary sentiment labels (positive or negative). You can use this trained model to make predictions on new texts and determine their sentiment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Dataset

The training data consists of two files:

1. `texts.txt`: A text file containing the input texts for training the sentiment analysis model.
2. `labels.txt`: A text file containing the binary labels (0 or 1) indicating the sentiment (negative or positive) for each corresponding text in `texts.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Place your training data in the project directory. Ensure that you have two files named `texts.txt` and `labels.txt` containing your training texts and labels, respectively.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

   This script will load the training data, preprocess it, build a sentiment analysis model, and train the model for 10 epochs. After training, the script will make predictions on new texts and display the predicted sentiment along with confidence scores.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the model architecture and training parameters in the script based on your specific requirements. You can adjust the embedding dimensions, LSTM units, and other hyperparameters to optimize the model for your dataset.

## Note

This script is a basic example, and the model's performance may vary depending on the nature of your dataset. Consider experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters for better results.
